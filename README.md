# How to get free freebies: tips and my real experiences

## Getting freebies isn’t just luck

Everyone loves free stuff, right? But getting free freebies isn’t just about waiting around for someone to give them away. I’ve tried lots of ways—snagging discount codes, signing up for trial programs, joining online giveaway groups. The key is knowing where and when to look, and often having the right tools to boost your chances.

## My experiences to get free freebies with a proxy

After a while, I realized using a proxy was one of the best “hacks” to get more freebies. Why? Because many websites or apps only let users from certain countries participate in giveaways. If you’re sitting in Vietnam without a proxy, you’ll get blocked. A proxy lets me spoof my IP to other countries, opening up chances to join freebie programs from the US, UK, Canada, and more.

## I used 9Proxy’s proxy service

I use 9Proxy because their service is stable, fast, and offers a wide range of IPs from different countries. This made grabbing freebies from international programs much easier—no blocks or interruptions. If you want to get free freebies effectively, investing in a quality proxy like 9Proxy is totally worth it.
